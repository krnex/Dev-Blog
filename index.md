## "Dead Man Walking"

"Dead Man Walking" is a working title for a 3D pirate, doom style, roguelite that is currently in development. I am a team of one, who has a dream to one day publish my own game, and Im hoping that this will be it.

### What is it?

In "Dead Man Walking" you play as a former pirate captain whos crew has mutinied, lead by your first mate. You where stabbed in the back when you least expected it and thrown into the depths to dissapear. As you faded out of consciousness, Davy Jones himself made you an offer. At the cost of your soul you can have your revenge. 

You wake on the shore of what appears to be a deserted island, your skin cold to touch, your heart no longer beating. From here you must make your way across the sea, to get revenge on those who wronged you.
